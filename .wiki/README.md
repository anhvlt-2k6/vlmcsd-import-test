## Use VLMCSD & License Manager

### Use the VLMCSD command line

| VLMCSD App | Description | Command line |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `vlmcs` | `vlmcs` is a program that can be used to test a KMS server that provides activation for Microsoft products. It supports KMS 4, KMS 5, and KMS 6 protocol. | [See the document](https://github.com/tfslabs/vlmcsd/blob/master/man/vlmcs.1.unix.txt) |
| `vlmcsd` | `vlmcsd` is a fully Microsoft-compatible KMS server that provides product activation services to clients. It is a drop-in replacement for a Microsoft KMS server. It supports KMS 4, KMS 5, and KMS 6 protocol. | [See the document](https://github.com/tfslabs/vlmcsd/blob/master/man/vlmcsd.7.unix.txt) |
| `vlmcsdmulti` | `vlmcsdmulti` is a multi-call binary that contains `vlmcs` and `vlmcsd` in a  single binary. Since both programs share much code and data, the combined binary is significantly smaller than the sum of both files. | [See the document](https://github.com/tfslabs/vlmcsd/blob/master/man/vlmcsdmulti.1.unix.txt)|

### Use VLMCSD on Docker

On a system having too many applications running, using `docker` is the better way to deploy, maintain, and retire `vlmcsd`

Containerized `vlmcsd` for both Linux and Windows are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/theflightsims/vlmcsd). By default, the container will expose port 1688.

* For Windows Server editions, these images are available for Windows Server 2016 and up. You can try to run these images by using these following command lines

```cmd
:: Windows Server 2016 container
docker run -p 1688:1688 theflightsims/vlmcsd:ltsc2016-amd64

:: Windows Server 2019 container
docker run -p 1688:1688 theflightsims/vlmcsd:ltsc2019-amd64

:: Windows Server 2022 container
docker run -p 1688:1688 theflightsims/vlmcsd:ltsc2022-amd64
```

* For Linux, containerized images are available for **supporting architectures**. You can try these available architectures by using following command lines

```bash
# AMD64
docker run -p 1688:1688 theflightsims/vlmcsd:linux-amd64

# ARM64
docker run -p 1688:1688 theflightsims/vlmcsd:linux-arm64

# S390X
docker run -p 1688:1688 theflightsims/vlmcsd:linux-s390x

# PPC64LE
docker run -p 1688:1688 theflightsims/vlmcsd:linux-ppc64le

# RISCv64
docker run -p 1688:1688 theflightsims/vlmcsd:linux-riscv64

# MIPS64LE
docker run -p 1688:1688 theflightsims/vlmcsd:linux-mips64le
```

## Build and developing

### Build & Manage Database

* License Manager database exports to VLMCSD

For the License Manager database exports to VLMCSD, please review in the License Manager manual.

* VLMCSD database

VLMCSD Database (or known as [vlmcsd.kmd](https://github.com/TheFlightSims/windowsserver-mgmttools/blob/master/vlmcsd-beta/database-config/vlmcsdb/vlmcsd.kmd)) is the binary, external vlmcsd database. You can configure it in [vlmcsd.ini](https://github.com/TheFlightSims/windowsserver-mgmttools/blob/master/vlmcsd-beta/database-config/vlmcsdb/vlmcsd.ini), or you can use CLI.

* Internal VLMCSD database

The internal VLMCSD databases are, both includes in `src/kmsdata.c` and `src/kmsdata-full.c` files.
